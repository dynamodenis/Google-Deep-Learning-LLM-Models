This means the model learns that they have similar meanings and serve similar functions in sentences."

        "In this lab, you **trained a small language model** from scratch by first creating and training a custom **byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer** on the Africa Galore dataset. You used this tokenizer to convert text into **subword tokens** and prepare the data for training. After training the transformer model, you observed how its ability to generate coherent text improved as it learned to combine these subword tokens into meaningful words and sentences. Finally, by visualizing the model's learned **embeddings** with t-SNE, you explored how it began to organize tokens into meaningful clusters. You observed how it grouped words with similar functions (e.g., prepositions) together in the embedding space."
